## ✨ Motivation
<p align="justify">
Counterfeiting harms brands, products, and consumers. 😡 Blockchain can stop it by tracking and verifying every transaction in the supply chain. 🙌 We will use Ethereum and Solidity to build a system that lets customers scan QR codes and check product authenticity on the blockchain. 🚀 This will protect consumers from fake products, enhance trust between buyers and sellers, and promote ethical business practices. 😊

## ⚡ Our Solution
<p align="justify">
We will build a blockchain-based system to manage medicine supply chains. 🏥 It will:

Verify the authenticity of medicines and stop counterfeiting. 💯
Record every product’s journey from the factory to the customer. 🛣️
Simplify the ordering and payment process, removing middlemen and fraud risks. 💸
Enable consumers to identify and report fake products, improving safety and quality. 🛡️
Our system, OneQR, is different from others because it can:

Analyze product distribution and detect imposters quickly. 🔎
Prevent fraudulent transactions before payment is processed. 🔒
Protect customers from receiving counterfeit or fake products. 🙅‍♂️
OneQR will ensure customer satisfaction and brand reputation. 😊
